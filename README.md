## 🎲 What is MultiverseCreatures?

MultiverseCreatures is a content plugin for **Minecraft 1.21+** that turns a server into a multiverse playground. Every vanilla mob spawn has a chance to be replaced with a themed custom creature; each one has its own AI, drops specialized crafting ingredients, and is the source of a legendary item referencing a different universe.

### ✨ Core Highlights

- **🛡️ THE OBSIDIAN SENTINEL** — fully animated 5-phase ArmorStand final boss with **45 attacks** (13 aerial · 14 ground · 12 ranged · 6 defensive), boss bar, megalovania music, magic seals, summoned reinforcements, defensive states — and a ground-recovery fallback that keeps it fighting instead of idling when the floor under it disappears. Its phase ladder (`phase-thresholds`), the three defence durations and the playerless-despawn timer are all `config.yml` keys.
- **👑 NIX** — the third boss, with its own invocation ritual, phased fight and private arena.
- **🤖 JACK STAR** — *The System Architect*: 5 phases, 3 lives, ritual invocation and builder defence.
- **🧠 Adaptive Bosses** — *Mahoraga* reads your **full inventory every tick** and evolves its stats in real time (Sharpness → Resistance, Protection → Strength, Knockback → knockback immunity, distance → Speed).
- **🥋 Primordial Martial Bosses** — *Garou [Hero Hunter]* with Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist, cosmic approach blink, counter-attacks, and the *Cosmic Core* relic drop.
- **⚔️ Legendary Weapons** — *Excalibur*, *Cinder Greatsword*, *Nullshear Edge*, *Soulreap Scythe*, *Aether Pullshot*, *Skyfire Talisman* — each with passive + active abilities, cooldowns, and themed lore.
- **🔮 Themed Relics** — *Ice King's Crown* (ice projectile + blizzard + ice-path), *Mantis Claws* (wall-cling + wall-jump via packet interception), *Wirt's Lantern* (mob repel + Night Vision + immunity).
- **🪖 Armor Sets** — *Eight-Handled Wheel* (damage-cause adaptation), *Obsidian Bastion* (4-piece set bonus with +40% Health, knockback immunity, fire/lava immunity), plus off-hand relics *Marrow Aegis* (damage reflect), *Veilwalker Mantle* (stealth + backstab) and *Frost Heart* (chill aura + Frost Walker).
- **🎒 Themed Food & Utility** — *Scooby Cookie* (Resistance VI), *Head Slime Gelatin* (Head Slime immunity), *Military Mine* (auto-camouflaged TNT).
- **🌿 Natural-spawn replacements** for Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Spiders, Witches, Blazes, Iron Golems, Endermen, Wither Skeletons, Evokers, Slimes — each with its own chance, fully configurable.
- **🐎 Full-Moon Military Ambush** — a rare 0.1% chance during a Full Moon to spawn a ZombieHorseTrap that unleashes a 5-unit undead army.
- **🛒 Multiverse Merchant** — 30% of Wandering Trader spawns become "Shaggy" with custom multiverse trades.
- **🎵 NBS Music Engine** — custom music playback (ships Megalovania as the boss theme).
- **🔮 Ritual Structures & Private Boss Dimension** — scaffolding for future boss invocation arcs.
- **⚙️ Fully Configurable** — every spawn chance, boss stat, item cooldown, death message and effect amplifier lives in `config.yml`.

## 🧩 Extending: reusing the 45 boss attacks

The boss attacks live behind a small interface so they are **not tied to one boss**.

```java
public interface BossHost {
    MultiverseCreatures getPlugin();
    void resetBossPose(BossInstance instance);
    Player detectTarget(ArmorStand stand);
    void spawnShockwaveWave(World world, Location center, double maxRadius);
    // plus defaults: getValidPlayers, getValidPlayersNear, launchPlayer,
    // getGroundY, isOnGround, countPlayersInRange, findNearestPlayer
}
```

Any boss that implements `BossHost` can reuse the attack classes as they are. **All but three are
host-agnostic**; those three reach for something only THE OBSIDIAN SENTINEL has — the netherite
lance, the shield timings and the sky pentagram — and cast explicitly, with a comment saying so.

Terrain and player queries live in `BossArena` as stateless helpers, so they can be called from
anywhere and tested on their own. The "is this player a valid target?" rule (skip dead, creative
and spectator) is decided in exactly one place.

> **Heads-up if you are writing a non-ArmorStand boss:** the attacks animate the boss through
> ArmorStand poses — `setHeadPose`, `setBodyPose`, arm poses — over 250 calls across the 45
> classes. A mob-based boss can reuse an attack's *effect* (damage, particles, projectiles) but
> not its choreography. Splitting each attack into "effect" and "animation" is the natural next
> step if that is needed.

---

## 🧪 Tests & CI

The suite runs **without a server or a network**: the logic that can be checked in isolation is kept
in classes that take plain arguments (phase ladders, help pagination, command catalogues, kill
filters, structure validators), so it runs in plain JUnit 5.

```bash
mvn verify                          # compile + tests + shaded jar
mvn test -Dtest=SpawnCatalogueTest  # one class only
```

CI runs `mvn verify` on every push and pull request
([verify.yml](.github/workflows/verify.yml)), and the Modrinth release workflow only publishes when
that gate passes. The [Tests wiki page](wiki-en/dev/Tests.md) documents every test class; the
Spanish version lives in [wiki-es/dev/Tests.md](wiki-es/dev/Tests.md).

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the latest `.jar` from the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/plugin/multiversecreatures).
2. Drop it into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start the server once to generate the default `config.yml`.
4. (Optional) Edit `plugins/MultiverseCreatures/config.yml` to tune spawn chances, cooldowns, boss stats, death messages, and effect amplifiers.
5. Restart and enjoy. Use `/msc spawn <type>` to summon anything, or wait for natural spawns to be replaced.

> **Requirements:** Paper / Purpur **1.21.11, 26.1 or 26.2** (built against `purpur-api 1.21.11`, checked against `paper-api` 26.1 and 26.2 with `mvn -P api-26.1 compile` / `mvn -P api-26.2 compile`) · **Java 21+** (26.x servers run on Java 25)

A full install guide lives in the [Installation wiki page](wiki-en/Installation.md).

---

## 🚀 Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chagui68/MultiverseCreatures.git
cd MultiverseCreatures
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Output JAR will be at `target/MultiverseCreatures-v<version>.jar`.

---

## 🛠️ Commands (Quick Reference)

All interactions use the `/msc` command. **Permission:** `msc.admin` (server OP by default).

```
/msc spawn <type>              Summon a mob/boss/merchant at your location (/msc spawn help)
/msc give <item> [n] [who]     Obtain an item (amount 1–64, target a player or @a) (/msc give help)
/msc seal <pattern> [plane]    Render a particle seal pattern
/msc dummy ...                 Spawn, pose, add wings or animate preview ArmorStands (/msc dummy help)
/msc attack <name> [range]     Trigger one of the 45 boss attacks or mechanics (/msc attack help)
/msc music <play|stop|list|disc>  Play or stop NBS songs, or get a music disc
/msc dimtp <world>             Teleport across worlds
/msc cleanstands [world]       Remove all MSC-related armor stands
/msc kill [type|all] [radius]  Purge MSC custom creatures safely
/msc reload                    Reload config.yml and re-sync entities and bosses
```

Full breakdown (alias tables, all spawn types, giveable items, attack names, seal patterns, dummy animations) is in the [Commands wiki page](wiki-en/Commands.md).
