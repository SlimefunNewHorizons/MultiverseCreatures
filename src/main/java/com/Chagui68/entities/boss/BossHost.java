/**
 * What an attack needs from its boss.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * The 42 plugin attacks were written against ArmorStandBoss, the concrete Obsidian Sentinel
 * class. They work perfectly, but depending on the concrete type prevents any other boss
 * from reusing them: to reuse an attack you had to copy it and change the type, which is
 * how two copies of the same code diverge.
 *
 * With this interface in the middle, any boss implementing it reuses the 42 attacks as-is.
 * The goal is for all server bosses to share the same attack logic and only differ in
 * values and presentation.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE AND WHAT DOES NOT
 *
 * Only generic concerns live here: who is nearby, where the ground is, how to push a player,
 * how to reset the pose. Sentinel-specific concerns — sky pentagram, netherite spear,
 * shield timings — stay in ArmorStandBoss, because a different boss may not need them.
