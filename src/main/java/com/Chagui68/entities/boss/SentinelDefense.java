/**
 * The Obsidian Sentinel's defences, frozen at the moment a hit lands, plus the pure maths that turns
 * that hit into the damage the boss actually loses.
 *
 * <p>The event handler used to inline this: halve for a planted shield seal, shave for a healing
 * circle, apply the active defence, spend the absorb shield, then clamp to
 * {@code max-damage-per-hit}. That is the boss's balance in one place, and it lived inside a
 * 2 300-line class with no test touching it. Here it is a {@code resolve} call with no server, no
 * entity and no side effect, so every step — including the order of the cap and the absorb shield —
 * is pinned by a test.
 *
 * <p>Everything that has to *happen* rather than be computed stays in the caller:
 * {@link Result#absorbed()} is subtracted from the live shield, {@link Result#reflected()} is thrown
 * back at the attacker, and {@link Result#shieldBroken()} and {@link Result#steps()} drive the
 * sounds and the {@code /msc debug} report.
 *
 * @param invulnerable     the boss is shielded during its invocation; the hit is ignored entirely
 * @param shieldSealActive a planted seal halves incoming damage
 * @param healingCircleActive the healing circle shaves a fifth off incoming damage
 * @param activeDefense    the defence currently up, or {@link DefenseState#NONE}
 * @param absorbShieldHealth health left on the absorb shield
 * @param cap              {@code max-damage-per-hit}, applied last
