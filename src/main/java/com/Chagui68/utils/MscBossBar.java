/**
 * Creation and viewer bookkeeping for the plugin's boss bars.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * A {@link BossBar} is a packet sent to individual players, so it is not tied to the world: whoever
 * is added at spawn keeps seeing it until it is taken away, and whoever joins later never sees it at
 * all. Every boss solved that differently — the Sentinel re-checked its viewers every tick, Jack Star
 * ran a one-second task that compared distances, and Nix and Kinger only ever added the players who
 * happened to be online the moment the boss spawned. With those rules a player who logged in later
 * fought the boss with no bar, and a player who left the world kept the bar of a fight they were no
 * longer in.
 *
 * Here the rule is one place: the bar belongs to the boss's world, and it takes a fresh look often
 * enough that a login, a logout or a world change corrects itself.
