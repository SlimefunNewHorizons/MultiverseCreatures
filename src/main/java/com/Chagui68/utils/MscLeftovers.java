/**
 * Cleans up the displays a boss attack left behind.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * An attack spawns its props — the Sentinel's orbiting shields, its planted shield holder, the ring
 * of lances, the wing panels, the mirror copies, the triangle seal — and removes them when the attack
 * ends. If the server stops mid-fight, nothing removes them: the attack object is gone, so the props
 * stay in the world as frozen litter that no command points at and no boss owns. Two of them were
 * even written with {@code setPersistent(true)}, so the world saved them and they came back on every
 * start.
 *
 * The sweep runs once, at enable, before any boss can be mid-attack: at that moment a tag from this
 * list can only belong to a fight that is over.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT in the list: the mob tags ({@code MSC_FrostGolem} and friends), which are
 * creatures with a life of their own; the suit pieces ({@code MSC_KingerPart}, {@code MSC_NixPart},
 * {@code MSC_JackPart}), which each boss adopts or removes on enable.
