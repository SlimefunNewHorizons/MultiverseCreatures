/**
 * Pins the {@code /msc attack} help table down.
 *
 * The attack list existed twice: once as the four help pages and once as the tab-completion list,
 * neither of them derived from the boss's attack registry. Both now come from one table, so the
 * text is compared against what the command printed before, and the completion names are checked to
 * be a clean superset of the old suggestion list.
 *
 * <p>Page 1 also gained the three ground attacks that only the wiki documented
 * ({@code lanceflurry}, {@code whirlwindslash}, {@code executionsweep}), so the help menu now
 * advertises all 96 registered attacks: the legacy pages plus the ten attacks of the second wave
 * (four ground, three aerial, three ranged) and the six of the third (three ground, two aerial, one
 * ranged) appended to the page they belong to, and six defences at the end of page 4. The ground
 * slam's line changed with its redesign.
