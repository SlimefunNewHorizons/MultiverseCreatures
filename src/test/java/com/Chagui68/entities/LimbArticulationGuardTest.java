/**
 * The dressed models are exports: somebody else decided how many pieces a limb has, and the code
 * decides which of those pieces a walk folds. When the two disagree the failure is silent — the
 * limb just swings rigid, or folds in the middle — and the per-model tests only look at the limbs
 * they were told about, so a re-export that splits a new limb in two, or shrinks one somebody
 * already folded, slips through all of them.
 *
 * <p>This guard walks <strong>every</strong> limb group of every dressed model and asks the export
 * for its answer: whatever the biggest gap between two stacked pieces is, that is where a joint
 * belongs, and the code has to fold exactly the pieces below it — no more and no fewer. A limb
 * exported in one piece may not report a joint; one exported in segments may not skip it.
 *
 * <p>Only limbs are asked to fold. A body group can be exported in several pieces with a visible
 * gap between them (Kinger's head has seven pieces, neck to cross) and still move as one block: the
 * torso leans around the waist, it does not bend in the middle. What the guard does insist on is
 * that such a group reports no joint at all, so a fold cannot be invented where the model has none.
