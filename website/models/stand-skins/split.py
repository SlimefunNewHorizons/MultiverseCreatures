"""
Cuts a full player skin into the eleven head skins of the plugin's head model.

The eleven-head humanoid is a player model cut in pieces, one pixel of skin being 1/16 of a head
of scale 0.937:

    head      the skin's head, as it is
    chest     the top 4 rows of the body          belly     its bottom 8 rows
    upper arm the top 4 rows of an arm            forearm   its bottom 8 rows
    thigh     the top 4 rows of a leg             shin      its bottom 8 rows

A head skin has six 8x8 faces, so every face of a piece is stretched to 8x8; the piece is drawn
squashed by the same amount (the chest is half as tall as the head), which puts every pixel back
where the skin had it. The outer layer (jacket, sleeves, trousers) becomes the head's outer
layer.
