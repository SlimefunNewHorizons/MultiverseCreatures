# 🧪 Tests

This page documents **how plugin changes are tested** and **what each suite verifies**. The tests only cover high-risk pure logic and math (bosses and rituals are easily broken when touched); there is no real server dependency.

## ⚙️ Framework & execution

- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)** — dependency `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.11.4` (`test` scope).
- **Maven Surefire 3.5.2** — runs the tests automatically during the `test` phase.
- **Java 21** — same compiler as the main code.
- **Headless**: no Paper/Purpur server is booted. Bukkit classes that get touched (e.g. `World`) are simulated with `java.lang.reflect.Proxy`, or `Location` objects with a `null` world are used to exercise only the arithmetic.
- **SnakeYAML** (shipped with `purpur-api`) parses `config.yml` and `plugin.yml` in `ConfigFilesGuardTest`, so an invalid indent fails the suite instead of the server start.
- **Test support** (`testsupport/ProjectPaths`, `testsupport/LimbGeometry`, `testsupport/SourceText`) is the harness the guards share: it finds the project by walking up from the working directory (a source-reading guard used to read `src/main/java` from wherever Maven was started, which found nothing and passed vacuously), names a file by path segments with one failure mode, reads a limb's second joint out of the export instead of trusting the code that hardcodes it,; and `SourceText` reads a method body or strips comments for the source-reading guards, so the three of them cannot drift apart.

Commands:

```bash
mvn test                     # Runs the whole suite
mvn clean package -DskipTests  # Builds the JAR skipping tests
```

To run one class:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=InvocationStructuresTest
```

## 📋 Test inventory

All 64 test classes live in `src/test/java/com/Chagui68/`, mirroring the package of the class they exercise.

### `utils/MscEntityUtilsHealthTest` — Boss virtual health
Covers the health math in `utils/MscEntityUtils`:
- **`calculateSafeHealth`** — Clamps the requested health to the server limit (attribute cap, default 1024 on Paper) to avoid `IllegalArgumentException`. Verifies real boss cases: ArmorStandBoss (3200), NIX (450), Frost Golem (200); clamps to a minimum of **0.1** (prevents instant death on spawn) and protects against negative input.
- **`calculateVirtualProgress`** — Clamps the boss-bar progress to [0.0, 1.0] (including `0/0` = 0).
- **`calculateScaledPhysicalHealth`** — Converts **virtual** health (e.g. 3200) into the real physical health stored on the entity (scaled to its physical max), with 0 → death.
- **`clampHitboxScale`** — Every boss's stand scale is clamped to `0.25`–`8.0`: the boundaries themselves stay usable, `0`, negatives, `NaN` and both infinities fall back to a plain stand (`1.0`), a huge value caps at `8.0`, and the four scales the bosses actually ship (`1.0`, `1.2`, `1.9`, `7.5`) pass through untouched.

### `utils/MscGeometryOverlayTest` — Geometry drawn in the world
- The hitbox overlay is drawn along the **twelve edges** of the box: each edge runs on exactly one axis, they add up to four of each side length and they meet at exactly the eight corners — an outline missing an edge would hide the gap the audit is looking for. A degenerate (empty) box still draws instead of throwing.
- A joint is placed in the **same frame the display pieces use** (`yaw + 180`): a stand facing north mirrors the model point, a quarter turn maps it onto the other axis, and no rotation ever changes its height or its distance from the stand.
- The joints the command actually hands over (Kinger's, NIX's and Jack Star's real pivot constants, **elbows and knees included**) all sit inside a body: within the stand's height, near the body axis and on its own plane.
- The **walk replay** builds its box from the hitbox scale alone (half a block wide and 1.975 tall at scale 1, centred on the anchor with its feet on it) and turns a posed limb into bones: one for a limb that does not fold, two that meet at its joint when it does. Kinger's rig is six bones, NIX's and Jack Star's eight.
- A source guard keeps the command wired: each of the three models that walks is replayable through `::walkPose` at its own `WALK_RATE`, and the drawing goes through the overlay — the replay cannot quietly drop a model, and it cannot become a second renderer.

### `utils/DisplaySuitTest` — The suit every dressed boss wears
- An adoption recognises a piece only when its **suit, piece and owner tags all agree**: a piece of another boss, another piece of the same suit, or a suit tag without the rest is never taken.
- The search skips entities that are not displays, returns nothing when there is nothing to adopt, and ignores a missing world or location.
- The suit is built in **one place**: a source guard fails if any of the three dressed bosses builds its own head from the skin texture, zeroes its own display settings or forgets to adopt/remove its pieces.
- `shouldSync` poses a busy suit every tick and a still one every third tick.

### `utils/MscLeftoversTest` — Startup sweep of attack props
- The props of an attack that a restart cut short are removed at enable (orbiting shields, the planted shield holder, the lance ring, the wing panels, the triangle seal, the mirror copies, Kinger's bullets), because their attack object is gone and nothing else would ever remove them.
- The list is tested from the other side too: **creatures** (`MSC_FrostGolem`, the summons), **suit pieces** (each boss adopts its own) and never swept. The markers of the retired `/msc dummy` and `/msc seal` (`MSC_Dummy`, `MSC_SealMarker`) are swept, since nothing owns them any more.
- The sweep only touches the entities it recognises — it does not unload the world around them — and a missing world is ignored instead of throwing.

### `utils/MscBossBarTest` — Who sees a boss bar
- A boss bar is a packet per player, not a world object, so the viewer list has to be revisited: a player who **logs in later** gets the bar and one who already had it is never added twice.
- A viewer who **logs out** or moves to another world stops seeing the bar; a distance-limited bar (Jack Star's) swaps its viewers for the players inside the range instead of accumulating them.
- A missing bar, world or location is ignored instead of throwing, so a bar handed over mid-teardown cannot break the ticker.

### `utils/MscLimbTest` — The second joint of a limb
- The joint between two export segments is **halfway between their centres**, so nothing has to be assumed about how big a piece is and a re-export moves the joint with it; a still limb rests exactly where the export puts it, second joint and all.
- Over the whole range a walk can reach, the lower segment keeps its exact distance from the second joint — it cannot come away from the limb — and stays below that joint instead of folding up through the thigh.
- A **knee** folds only on the back half of the swing and an **elbow** only on the forward half, both by a documented share of the parent's swing (`1.5×`, capped at `1.2` rad ≈ 69°) and always in the direction the limb is already going, so a joint adds to the swing instead of leading or cancelling it.
- Posing a limb keeps it rigid — the pivot does not move and both bones keep their lengths — while a fold brings the hand or foot closer to the joint it hangs from than the straight limb reaches. A limb exported in one piece swings rigid and never grows a joint it does not have.

### `ritual/BossDimensionTest` — The ritual dimension's world
- Every vanilla generation stage stays off in `WastelandGenerator`: `shouldGenerateNoise()` returning true would generate overworld terrain under and around the battlefield.
- The world border is 1500 blocks by default and is clamped to 100 - 1500 whatever the config says.
- A world folder without the generator marker, or with another generator's name in it, is detected as outdated (and rebuilt); one carrying the current marker is kept.

### `ritual/terrain/WastelandTest` — The battlefield a fight gets
- The arena is flat at y=40 and nothing stands on it or within 40 blocks of it; around it no step is taller than one block, and there is no lava within the hazard radius.
- Lava never rises above its level and always meets lava or rock sideways and below; every column has bedrock at y=0 and is solid up to its surface; a mountain range stands all along the edge.
- Every hazard and structure (lava, magma, both fires, spikes, bones, ruins, all three grounds) appears on the battlefield, the same seed rebuilds the same columns, and another seed grows a different wasteland around the same arena.

### `ritual/InvocationStructuresTest` — Every summoning structure
- The four 5×5 altars (NIX's scaffold, DIO's throne, JACKSTAR's terminal and the pantheon altar) share one layout, checked once for all four: four candles on the ground layer at **Manhattan distance 1** from the centre, four pillars on the corners.
- Each structure puts its centre and markers where the ritual expects them: NIX's anvil at `origin + (2.5, 0.5, 2.5)` and its gallows glow at `Y + 1.8`, DIO's throne and the pantheon altar one block up, DIO's pillar light at `Y + 2.6`, the overworld ritual's centre at `(3, 0, 3)` with radius 5 and the Sentinel circle's at `(2, 0, 2)`.
- Only the candle spots count as candles — never the centre, a pillar or anything outside — for NIX, JACKSTAR and the Sentinel's 12-candle ring; the overworld ritual has exactly 12 candles on layer `Y=1`, none on the centre.
- JACKSTAR's core, candle and base blocks accept what the ritual documents and nothing else, and any skull or head crowns one of DIO's pillars.

### `commands/CommandCatalogueTest` — `/msc spawn`, `give` and `attack` tables and their help pages
- Each table is the one source the executor, the help and tab completion read, so the test checks they agree: **one lowercase name per entity, item or attack**, looked up in any case, and the retired shortcuts (`army`, `sword`, `warrant`, `slam`, `heal`, `crossbarrage`, …) are gone.
- `spawn`: every documented kind is listed exactly once, Jack stays out of the help, and every kind builds its success and failure message.
- `give`: every name the help shows (grouped lines like `reaperessence &8/ &evoidessence` included) is a givable item with a factory.
- `attack`: the help lists every registered attack plus the seven mechanics (`flyup`, `land`, `reset`, `phase*`), the same list `ArmorStandBoss.COMMAND_MECHANICS` runs.
- The page maths of the real `CommandMenu`: pages clamp into `[1, total]`, the count covers every line with at least one page, every line shows on exactly one page, and every page of every menu has a title and lines.

### `commands/AttackRegistryCoherenceTest` — the five attack lists stay in agreement
- Reads the attack sources and `ArmorStandBoss` and checks that every attack class is registered in `initAttacks()` and answers to the name derived from its class (with the documented exceptions `executionsweep`, `soultethers`, `runemines`).
- The aerial/ground sets match the folders the classes live in, no attack sits in both sets, and the ranged/defensive ones stay in neither.
- The help catalogue and the sources are the same set of names, so nothing is advertised that cannot run and nothing runnable stays hidden.

### `commands/MscKillFilterTest` — `/msc kill` predicates
- `MSC_`-prefixed scoreboard tags identify a plugin entity; the legacy untagged names (Mahoraga, Garou, Bone Shield, …) still count; vanilla mobs are left alone.
- The type filter matches tags with `-`/`_` stripped and falls back to a name substring; `null`/blank types never match.

### `entities/boss/NixDamageCapTest` — NIX damage cap
- Nix can never lose more than `entities.nix-executioner.max-damage-per-hit` (default **100**) from a single hit: anything above is clamped, anything below passes through untouched, and the cap never *inflates* a hit.
- `0` (or any non-positive value) disables the limit, which is the documented way back to the old unbounded behaviour.
- Pins the health-pool arithmetic down: a 10 000-damage burst leaves 350 of 450 HP, four capped hits leave 50, the fifth finishes the boss.

### `entities/boss/PenetratingDamageTest` — Sentinel penetrating damage
- **Armour is credited back**: the engine folds `ARMOR`, `MAGIC` (Protection enchantments) and `RESISTANCE` into the event damage, and `unmitigated` undoes those three so a 22-damage cleave survives full netherite. Shield blocking is deliberately *not* credited back, and the result never goes negative.
- `penetratingDamage` keeps Resistance partially effective: the boss ignores `penetrating-resistance-pierce` (default **0.2**) of the potion's reduction, so Resistance I blocks 16% instead of 20% (a 10 hit deals 8.4), `0.0` leaves the potion fully effective and `1.0` ignores it entirely. Mitigation is 20% per level and caps at 100% (Resistance V).
- Out-of-range pierce values are clamped, a hit can never grow past the raw damage, and the per-hit cap (`max-damage-dealt`, 15) is applied before Resistance so the potion can never raise it.
- `PenetratingHit` chains the same steps the live handler runs (credit back, cap, pierce) and is what `/msc debug` prints: a full-netherite 22-damage cleave comes back as 12.6, a hit absorbed by armour ends at 0 instead of a negative or `NaN`, Resistance is reported as a one-based level and the age never goes negative.

### `entities/boss/SentinelDefenseTest` — Sentinel incoming damage
- Pins the boss's whole defensive stack, now extracted from its event handler into `SentinelDefense`: shield seal ×0.5, healing circle ×0.8, stone skin ×0.5, reflect barrier ×0.7, the absorb shield spending its health, and the `max-damage-per-hit` cap applied **last**.
- Checks the traps the inline version hid: the defences cannot raise a hit above the cap (`200 → 40 → capped 30`), a hit exactly at the cap is not marked as capped, the reflect barrier returns 30% of the *reduced* hit and the cap does not shrink what it returns, and an invulnerable boss produces no cap step at all.
- The `steps` trace is asserted byte-for-byte because `/msc debug` prints it, and a sweep over every defence combination proves no defence can enlarge a hit or return a negative value.

### `commands/DebugReportTest` — `/msc debug` rendering
- Pins the rendered lines without a sender: a penetrating hit lists its event damage, the credited-back armour/Protection/Resistance, the through-armour total, the cap, the pierce, the Resistance level and the final value; a `DEALT` sample pairs the attack's intended damage with what the player actually took; a `TAKEN` sample spells out the cap or load-balancer split between the hit and what it cost.
- An empty mechanic note is skipped instead of leaving a dangling separator, and the age line is driven by an injected clock so the output is deterministic.

### `entities/boss/BossDamageLogTest` — `/msc debug` registry
- Keeps one sample per player, boss and direction: a newer sample replaces the older one in its slot, and `samplesFor` returns them ordered by `BossId` then direction regardless of insert order, so the report cannot reshuffle between runs.
- Players are tracked independently, `forget` clears one without touching another, and null records are ignored rather than throwing.
- `forgetBoss` drops one boss's samples for every player in a single sweep and leaves the other bosses intact — the same call the log's own listener runs when a boss stand leaves the world.

### `entities/boss/JackResilienceTest` — Jack Star incoming damage
- Every hit resolves through one door: an explicit dodge takes nothing, anything else is split.
- The split **conserves the hit** (`toBoss + sharedTotal == incoming`) across a sweep of damage values and party sizes, so a tuning change cannot quietly delete or duplicate damage.
- A landed hit **always reaches the boss** whatever the party size, which is what keeps Jack Star damageable at all times; a roll exactly on the dodge chance still lands.
- The compressed (demoted) form raises the configured chance to 0.45, and the boundary value keeps the configured one.

### `entities/boss/JackModelTest` — Jack Star model geometry
- The eleven parts match the **in-game reference model** up to one shared X offset, and the model is **re-centred on the hitbox**; head above torso above legs, the head top near two blocks.
- The slash bends elbows and knees, shape shifting scales translations and part scales together, and the stand's hitbox covers the head, torso and legs (the arms sit outside it by design).

### `entities/boss/HumanoidRigTest` — What NIX and Jack Star share
- One contract run over both rigs. **Rest pose**: left and right limbs mirrored, no two parts in one place, each part on its joint's side and axis, a swinging limb keeping its X and never leaving its joint, and each **elbow and knee where the export leaves the biggest gap** between a limb's segments (derived from the geometry, never taken from the code).
- **Walk**: only the lower half of a limb folds, by the angle its own limb walks with; every part stays over the stand's hitbox (Jack's arms excepted by design); the replay's skeleton keeps rigid bones and fixed pivots, folds at exactly the display pieces' joints, puts the foot behind on the back half of the step and the hand in front on the forward half; and the boss steps at its model's `WALK_RATE`.

### `entities/boss/NixModelTest` — NIX model geometry
- The 27 parts are pinned against the **exported model**: every translation matches and the whole body shares one X axis. The model is **centred on the hitbox** (`NixModel.baseTranslation` puts the spine at zero instead of the export's `+0.066`), and `CENTER` is the **midpoint of the exported extents**, which no added part can pull around.
- Head above torso above legs, the head top near two blocks, the feet off the ground; arms and legs of six pieces each.
- The **hitbox test** keeps `MODEL_HITBOX_SCALE` covering the whole rest pose while staying within 0.05 of the smallest scale the model needs.
- The cleave folds the elbows on the wind-up, straightens them on the chop and flexes the knees.
- A source guard keeps the parts from lagging (`setTeleportDuration`/`setInterpolationDuration`/`setDisplayWidth`/`setDisplayHeight` all zero, configured in one place) and requires a reload to **adopt** the parts it already has instead of spawning a second body.

### `entities/LimbArticulationGuardTest` — Every exported segment is articulated
- Cross-model guard over the three dressed bosses: it walks **every** limb group of every model's part enum — not the hand-written list the per-model tests use — and asks the export for its answer. Wherever the biggest gap between two stacked pieces is, a joint belongs there, and the code must fold exactly the pieces below it, no more and no fewer.
- Fails when a limb is exported in two segments the code never articulates (half the limb would swing rigid forever) and when the code folds a limb the export left in one piece. It also proves at least one limb *was* articulated per model, so the guard cannot pass vacuously.
- It found a real one while being written: Kinger's `TORSO_UPPER` is two pieces 19 cm apart. That is not a joint — the torso leans around the waist and does not bend in the middle — so the guard asks body groups for **no** joint, and the finding is documented in the class instead of being papered over with a gap threshold.

### `entities/KingerModelTest` — Kinger model geometry
- The fifteen suit pieces are pinned against the **exported model**: every translation matches, the trunk and the legs share one Z axis, and each half of a leg is stacked on its own X so a swinging leg cannot split sideways.
- `CENTER` is the **torso axis** (the midpoint of the two torso pieces) instead of the mean of the fifteen anchors or the bounding-box midpoint, which the arms pull 0.03 and 0.08 blocks forward; the trunk, the legs and the head all sit on that axis, and re-centring never touches a height.
- Every piece belongs to a **limb group**: the pieces of a group keep their distances while swinging, no piece slides sideways or flies off its joint, and no two pieces share a place.
- A limb has **two joints where the export has two segments and one where it does not**: the shin folds at the knee the export leaves between the thigh and the shin (compared against the biggest gap in the leg's own geometry), the thigh and the boot plate stay rigid, Kinger's one-piece arms expose no second joint at all, and a still boss (or one whose swing is on the forward half of the step) folds nothing.
- The **hitbox test** keeps `MODEL_HITBOX_SCALE` covering the whole rest pose (0.5 wide, 1.975 tall) while staying within 0.1 of the 0.94 the geometry strictly needs — the old literal `2.0` doubled the box in every direction and swallowed swings at thin air.
- A second hitbox test **walks the whole gait**: a step bends the knee and carries the shin further from the axis than the rest pose does, so every piece is checked over a full cycle of `walkSwing`, with **no slack allowance at all**. The stride is tuned so even the deepest step keeps the folded shin over the stand's 0.5-wide box: a swing that misses the stand hits nothing, so the budget for "the leg looks lively" is the box and nothing more.
- Every piece's tag is unique and carries its owner, so an adoption cannot mix two pieces up; a source guard keeps the pieces from lagging (`setTeleportDuration`/`setInterpolationDuration`/`setInterpolationDelay`/`setDisplayWidth`/`setDisplayHeight` all zero, configured in one place), requires a reload to **adopt** the suit it already has instead of spawning a second, overlapping one and to **rebuild that boss's boss bar** (with the virtual health its progress is read from), and keeps the animation going through `KingerModel.compose` rather than a per-piece transform.
- The **walk pose** the replay draws is checked as a skeleton: four limbs — Kinger's knees folding at the export's joint, his one-piece arms rigid and jointless — with both bones keeping their length and the pivot fixed at every phase, every point inside the stand's 0.5-wide box, and the knee folding the foot behind the straight leg and closer to the hip. A source check keeps the mob stepping at `KingerModel.WALK_RATE`.

### `entities/handler/MobHandlerRecountTest` — Population cap cooldown
- `MobHandler.puedeRecontar` allows re-counting **per world**, respecting an independent failure cooldown per world: `world` with cooldown until `160000` does not re-count at `159999` but does at `160000`; `world_nether` is not blocked by `world`'s cooldown.

### `entities/EnderKnightWorldGuardTest` — Ender Knight teleport
- `EnderKnight.sharesWorld` only returns `true` when the worlds match; a `null` world identity is rejected. Guarantees the pull-distance math only happens within the same world.

### `entities/boss/attack/ChoreographyTest` — Every Sentinel attack, played offline
- Finds every class that extends `ChoreographedAttack` in the sources (all 61) and plays it to the end on a `RecordingStage`: it ends, gives at least 20 ticks a player can read, locks the body for no less than 15 ticks and no longer than it plays, draws and sounds, leaves no prop behind and returns to its guard (or hover). The stage refuses a particle spawned without the data it needs.
- With players standing in the usual fighting spots, every offensive attack hits at least one of them, so a telegraph that warns about a place the blow never reaches is caught.

### `entities/boss/SignatureMovesTest` — NIX's and JackStar's signature moves
- Every frame of Blood Harvest, Gallows Leap, Condemnation, fork(), Binary Rain and Stack Overflow is a real rotation, no elbow or knee folds past `MscLimb.MAX_BEND`, no limb turns more than 1.2 rad between two ticks, and each move ends close to the rest pose.
- The blows line up with the body: arms overhead in the air and down on the landing, the condemning arm up while the sentence holds and down when the blades fall, the throwing arm cocked before the release and forward after it.

### `entities/boss/SentinelAttackPoolTest` — The Sentinel's attack rotation
- Every registered attack is drawn from some pool or driven by the AI loop itself, and every pooled name is a registered attack, so an attack cannot be added and then never used (`doombeam` and `rainoflances` were).
- Each aerial pool holds enough attacks for a flight to end early, a pick never repeats one of the last six attacks while anything else is left, and a pool smaller than the history still yields an attack.

### `entities/boss/BossWalkTest` — How the bosses walk
- `BossArena.nextFeetY`: level ground stays level, one block up is a step, anything taller is a wall, and a ledge or a bottomless drop is fallen off gradually instead of hung over; settling converges exactly on the floor.

### `entities/boss/JackStarBossTest` — Jack Star's phases
- Each health band maps to its phase with the boundaries included, kernel panic is always the last phase, and every limb group has the number of pieces its joints expect.

### `entities/KingerMeleeTest` — Kinger's melee swing
- The hit lands at the peak of the swing, not on the tick it starts, only reaches players in front of him, and its reach is a sphere rather than a cube.

### `listener/bossdimension/BossFightGuardTest` — Commands during a boss fight
- `/say`, `/me`, `/help`, `/?` and `/dimtp` still run mid-fight in any case and with a namespace, while a command that merely starts like one of them (`/menu`, `/sayhi`, `/helpop`) is blocked.

### `entities/boss/BossArenaGroundRecoveryTest` — Ground recovery
- `findFloorY` returns the floor altitude, and **`NaN`** — not the boss's own Y — when the scan reaches nothing. That distinction is the fix: the old convenience method made "standing on the floor" and "nothing underneath" the same value, so a grounded boss stopped attacking forever.
- `getGroundY` keeps its documented fallback of returning the current Y, pinned down so the two behaviours cannot drift back together.
- `ringOffsets` starts at the origin, contains every offset within the radius exactly once and never goes back towards the origin — the nearest usable column must always win.
- `findUsableColumn` prefers the boss's column, walks outward when it is void, respects the search radius and reports `null` when nothing is usable so the caller can try the target column and then the world spawn.
- `findFloorY` always answers a block's top face: a boss hovering half a block over the floor is told the floor's height, not its own Y (that kept the Sentinel floating without attacking), a body sunk into a block is lifted onto it, and a slab is stood on at its own height.

### `utils/MscWorldPolicyTest` — World allowlist
- An **empty (or missing) allowlist means every world**, which is what `config.yml` documents. The implementation used to treat it as a hardcoded list of five world names, so a server with a custom world name silently got no conversions — and its periodic recount deleted any MSC creature it found there.
- A populated list restricts, with case and surrounding blanks normalized.
- The plugin's own worlds (`boss_dimension`, `drakes_bosses`) stay allowed even behind an explicit allowlist.

### `commands/CommandPermissionTest` — `/msc` permission rule
- Holding `commands.permission` is enough to run `/msc`, with or without OP.
- `commands.op-only: true` keeps operators working when they lack the node; setting it to `false` means only the node counts.
- A plain player with no node and no OP is denied.
- A subcommand with no configured node stays open to whoever passed the main gate, while one pinned under `commands.subcommand-permissions` needs its node on top of it.

### `entities/HeadSlimeImmunityTest` — Head Slime gelatin immunity
- The immunity window is a deadline per player, so eating a second gelatin **extends** it instead of the older scheduled removal ending it early, and nothing outlives the window after a logout.
- An expired window is dropped on access, and `clearAllImmunity()` is called from `onDisable`.

### `entities/boss/SentinelPhaseTest` — Sentinel phase ladder
- The ladder **reproduces the old hardcoded comparison chain exactly**: a sweep of health fractions from −5% to 105% is checked against the `> 0.8 / > 0.6 / > 0.4 / > 0.2` chain the boss used to inline, plus the exact boundaries (at precisely 80% health the boss is already in phase 1), nonsense inputs, and that the phase only ever grows as health drops.
- `sanitizeThresholds` drops thresholds outside `(0, 1]` and non-finite ones, sorts the rest highest first, collapses duplicates (they would be a zero-width phase), keeps `1.0`, returns an immutable list, and falls back to the defaults when a config edit leaves nothing usable.
- The generated boss bar titles are asserted **byte for byte** against the five strings the old switch held, for the default five phases and for a rescaled three-phase ladder — including that a phase past the end cannot emit a negative number of squares.
- Bar colours follow the phases, and a longer ladder reuses the last colour of the palette instead of falling back to red.

### `entities/boss/SentinelHitboxTest` — The Obsidian Sentinel's own stand
- The Sentinel is not a suit on an invisible stand, it **is** the scaled stand, so one number is at once the size of the model and the box players hit: `MODEL_HITBOX_SCALE` is pinned at `7.5` (about fourteen blocks of warrior), inside the range the clamp allows and wide enough to be hit.
- The scale is read from `armor-stand-boss.hitbox-scale` and **clamped**, never a literal inside `trySpawn` again — the code that sets it from a bare `7.5` is a failure.
- The two numbers of the arrival pentagram (its duration and its radius) are named constants the seal call passes, so the timing and the arena size are not buried in a call site.
- The stand the fight is hit through is configured in **exactly one place**: arms on, no base plate, no gravity, invulnerable off, persistent, named and tagged — each of those is asserted to appear once in the source, because a second spawn path forgetting one would produce a boss the fight cannot be won against.

### `utils/MscTextTest` — Item and mob name parity
- Every helper that builds item names, lore, flavour quotes and the `✦ … ✦` footers is serialised back with `LegacyComponentSerializer.legacySection()` and compared to the exact `ChatColor` string it replaced, so the migration cannot shift a space, a colour code or a bold flag unnoticed.
- Covers the mid-sentence colour switches (`rich`), the empty spacer lines (`blank`), the colourless names (`plain`) and the argument validation of `rich`.
- Pins the legacy rule that a **colour code clears bold**: a bold prefix followed by another colour stays bold only on the prefix, which is why the Garou name tag is built as two siblings instead of a decorated parent. A child would inherit the bold, and the test keeps that trap visible.
- `plainText` is the counterpart used to **compare** a name rather than show it, so it must strip every code and return an empty string for a nameless entity.

### `ConfigFilesGuardTest` — Resource contract (`config.yml` / `plugin.yml`)
- Parses both resources with SnakeYAML, so a broken indent or a lost section fails the build instead of the server start.
- Scans `src/main/java` for quoted config paths and fails if any of them is missing from `config.yml`. Nothing else enforced the header's "all paths match the code" promise: the Nullshear Edge handler read five `items.nullshear-edge.*` keys that were not in the file, and two Excalibur passive keys were documented but hardcoded, both falling back to code defaults silently.
- Asserts `plugin.yml` keeps the command, the `msc.admin` node (the same one `commands.permission` declares), the `msc.admin.bypass` node used by the boss-dimension handlers, and a `usage` line listing every sub-command.
- Checks the player-facing knobs stay sane: the Sentinels `phase-thresholds` descend inside `(0, 1]`, defence durations are at least one tick, `boss-balance.despawn` has sane radii and `delay-ticks` allows `0`, and every toggleable mob keeps its `enabled` flag.
- A self-test proves the literal scanner reports dotted literals outside comments and ignores the ones inside them.
- Asserts `commands.subcommand-permissions` exists as an **empty map** by default: the documented escape hatch must not disappear silently, and the shipped config must not restrict anything by surprise.
- Asserts **every** boss ships the hitbox scale its geometry test proves is right (`kinger.hitbox-scale` 1.0, `nix-executioner.hitbox-scale` 1.9, `jackstar-architect.hitbox-scale` 1.2, `armor-stand-boss.hitbox-scale` 7.5 — the Sentinel's own body), inside the 0.25–8 range a hand-edited value gets clamped to — the knob and the geometry tests have to agree out of the box.

### `utils/SourceGuardsTest` — Rules read off the sources
- **FLASH needs a colour**: every `spawnParticle(Particle.FLASH, …)` carries a `Color`, since 1.21 throws without one (a JackStar reboot did, on every hit).
- **No silent catch**: comments, strings and chars are stripped (line numbers kept) and every `catch` body under `src/main/java` must do something; empty allow-list, floor of 40 catches so the scan cannot pass vacuously.
- **Names are Components**: no file goes back to the deprecated String name APIs (`setDisplayName`, `setLore`, `setItemName`, `setCustomName`, `getDisplayName`, `getCustomName`); matches inside comments are ignored, the scan covers the whole source set, and a sample with all six APIs proves the detector catches them.

### `utils/MscLogTest` — Reported failures
- The twenty-one catch blocks that used to swallow their exception (`catch (Exception ignored) { }`) now report through `utils/MscLog`; this suite drives it with a capturing `Handler` and asserts the plugin logger is actually asked to print.
- A tolerated failure is logged at `FINE` and an actionable one at `WARNING`, always with the context, the exception's simple name and its message — a `NumberFormatException` keeps the offending input.
- An exception without a message is still named (`java.lang.IllegalStateException`), a null one reports `unknown error` instead of throwing, and `init(null)` keeps the previous logger so the startup order cannot silence the plugin.

### `utils/MscConfigMigrationTest` — Config upgrades
- The merge rule is pure and tested: only paths the file lacks are reported, an operator's edited value is never listed as missing, and a path is dotted all the way through sections while a **list stays a leaf** (indexing into it would invent keys that are not in the file).
- Reads `config.yml` and asserts it declares the same `config-version` as `MscConfigMigration.CONFIG_VERSION`, so a release cannot ship a file the code disagrees with, nor a version bump that never happened.
- Reads `MultiverseCreatures.onEnable` and proves the migration runs **after `saveDefaultConfig()` and before the first `getConfig()`**: `saveDefaultConfig()` only writes a config when there is none, so a key added by an update would otherwise stay invisible on every server that already exists.
- Reads `MSCCommand.handleReload` and proves `/msc reload` re-reads the file, merges the shipped defaults and only then reloads the handlers — a server that updated the plugin picks up the new keys from a reload, not only from the next restart.

### `utils/SchedulerHandleGuardTest` — Every looping task can be stopped
- A source guard: it strips comments, finds every `.runTaskTimer(` / `.scheduleSyncRepeatingTask(` under `src/main/java`, and demands each site be one of two shapes — a runnable whose own body calls `cancel()`, or a task whose handle survives the statement (a call made on a name: `task`, `instance.flyTask`; or an `x = new BukkitRunnable() { … }.runTaskTimer(…)` assignment). A floor of 100 sites keeps the scan on the whole project.
- The scanner follows braces, not line order: it matches `new BukkitRunnable()` to its own closing brace (`org.bukkit.scheduler.BukkitRunnable` included), so a one-shot task nested inside a longer loop no longer hides that loop's `cancel()`, and it reads an `instance.<field>` receiver through its declaration.
- A second test proves the handles are not decoration: every handle on a task that does not cancel itself must be cancelled somewhere in the project (`task.cancel()`, `instance.defenseTask.cancel()`), returned to the caller (`return task;` for the seals the boss cancels early) or handed to a name that is cancelled in turn (`instance.aiTask = ai;`).
- Written against the code as it was, it found twenty-four unowned loops: one per custom mob (Head Slime had two), one per boss, the Excalibur passive, the item auras (Wirt's Lantern, Mantis Claws, Frost Heart, Obsidian Bastion) and the population recount — all of them now hold their `BukkitTask` and stop through the new `stopTasks()`.
- A third test keeps the shutdown honest: `onDisable` has to call `stopAll()`, `unloadBossDimension()` and the ticker stop, so a reload cannot leave a loop walking state nobody reads.

### `entities/boss/seal/SealPlaneTest` — Where a seal lands
- The plane mapping is an isometry: a ring mapped onto XZ, XY or YZ keeps its radius, any two points keep their distance, a flat seal keeps one height and a vertical one keeps one axis, and the normal offset only moves the seal along its own normal (XZ up, XY along Z, YZ along X). That is the entire difference between a seal on the floor and one standing in the air.

### `entities/boss/seal/SealGeometryTest` — The shapes and their rules
- A circle keeps its radius, its sample count and its spacing; a pentagram is five chords that visit every vertex exactly twice — the failure message names the double-drawn chord the old drawing had on its first edge — and a triangle divides its sample budget over three equal sides. A star ring zigs twelve times between the outer ring and the inner 55 %, closing on itself, and a rune band keeps every point between its two radii and reproduces itself from a seeded random.
- The rules with numbers are pinned: sample floors (60 lines / 220 ring), aura count and radius, the 1.24 enclosing ring, the vertical 1.3× celestial scale, the shield column that never collapses below half a block, the spiral that stays inside it, and the documented bands of the vortex, quake, divine and cross-pulse wanderings.

### `entities/boss/seal/WingGeometryTest` — The wings
- Every feather runs from its shoulder to a tip inside `length + reach`, the two wings mirror each other exactly (flap included), a quarter turn rotates the whole cloud with the stand, and a flap rotates each feather rigidly instead of stretching it.
- The profiles are checked as data: the burning wings are the longer, fuller, slower pair, and no profile may zero a constant. The NaN check is not theoretical — the last feather used to evaluate `Math.pow(sin(π + 0.1), 1.5)` on a negative base, which is NaN, so the geometry clamps the sine before the power.

### `entities/boss/seal/SealOrchestrationGuardTest` — The listener stays a brush
- The listener has exactly one `.runTaskTimer(` (every seal goes through the shared loop), it contains no trigonometry, and the pure package mentions no server type at all: no `org.bukkit`, no `Particle`, no `Location`.
- It also fails if the listener stops delegating (fewer than 20 geometry calls) or grows back past 700 lines — the file is 573 after the split, down from 1088 with no behavior change.

## 🗃️ Where they run

Tests execute during Maven's **`test` phase** (Surefire). They need no server or network: just the JDK 21 and the dependencies declared in `pom.xml`.

They also run in CI: `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs `mvn verify` on every push to `main` and on every pull request. Publishing to Modrinth (`modrinth-publish.yml`) waits for that job, because its own build step uses `-DskipTests`.

> When touching health/boss logic, ritual structures, or the NIX/Kinger kinematic models, run the full suite with `mvn test` to make sure you are not introducing regressions.
