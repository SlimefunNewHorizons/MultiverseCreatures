# ⚔️ Weapons

All weapons are unbreakable and use a `msc_<item>` persistent data tag. Each one has a `ItemBuilder`-constructed ItemStack with lore and is registered with a custom recipe in `MultiverseCreatures.registerRecipes()`. The behaviour lives in a `listener/<Name>Handler.java`.

Use **`/msc give <item>`** (OP-only) to obtain any weapon during testing. See [Commands](./Commands.md) for the full give list.
