# 🪖 Armor & Relics

This page covers armor pieces and off-hand relics. All items are unbreakable and use `ItemBuilder` + `msc_<item>` persistent data tags. Each armor/handler self-registers via `MultiverseCreatures.onEnable()`.

## 🪖 Armor

### Eight-Handled Wheel (Jujutsu Kaisen — Mahoraga)

> "That which adapts cannot break, that which breaks cannot return."

A crown carved from a fragment of the Eight-Handled Wheel that once turned against all harm.

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| Material | NETHERITE_HELMET |
| Charges | 8 (`MAX_CHARGES = 8`) |
| Charge regen | 1 charge per `CHARGE_REGEN_TICKS` (200 ticks = 10 s); regen starts when first charge consumed |
| Active (passive) | **Adaptation** — on receiving damage, consume 1 charge to become **immune to that DamageCause for 8 seconds** |
| Block cooldown | 15 s per damage cause (`BLOCK_COOLDOWN_MS`); multiple damage types in the same tick spawn separate immunity effects |
| Particles / Sound | END_ROD, BLOCK_BEACON_ACTIVATE |
| Unbreakable | Yes |

The wheel **learns the type of damage you take**, then adapts. Different damage causes have independent cooldowns.

- **Give:** `/msc give eighthandledwheel`
- **Craft:** Refined Wheel Core (Wheel Essence → Wheel Core → *Blast Furnace* → Molten Wheel Core + Molten Netherite → Refined Wheel Core) + 4 Netherite Blocks (see [Recipes](./Recipes.md))
- **Theme:** Jujutsu Kaisen (Mahoraga drop → Wheel Essence)

### Obsidian Bastion (4-piece Netherite set)

> "Blacker than night, harder than resolve."

| Piece | Material |
|---|---|
| Helm | NETHERITE_HELMET |
| Chestplate | NETHERITE_CHESTPLATE |
| Greaves | NETHERITE_LEGGINGS |
| Sabatons | NETHERITE_BOOTS |

All 4 pieces ship pre-enchanted with **Protection IV · Blast Protection IV · Thorns II · Unbreaking III**.

### Full set bonus

| Effect | Value |
|---|---|
| Max Health | **+40%** (`MAX_HEALTH_BONUS = 0.4` AttributeModifier) |
| Knockback Resistance | **1.0** (full immunity) |
| Fire / Lava immunity | Yes (`FIRE`, `LAVA`, `FIRE_TICK` damage causes cancelled) |
| Movement Speed penalty | **-20%** (`SPEED_PENALTY = 0.2` AttributeModifier) |

The set bonus is re-checked on join/quit/item-break and broadcasts "set bonus activated/lost" chat messages. Reference implementation for armor-set modifiers: idempotent `getModifier(key)` check before adding, `removeModifier(key)` on cleanup — no per-player maps needed.

- **Give:** `/msc give obsidianbastionhelmet` (and `obsidianbastionchestplate` / `obsidianbastionleggings` / `obsidianbastionboots`)
- **Theme:** Multiverse (Obsidian Guard chain via Obsidian Shard)
