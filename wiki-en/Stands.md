# 🏹 The Arrow and the Stands (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure)

The Arrow chooses who gets a Stand… and who dies. DIO's blood makes you a Stand bearer: the
Arrow can no longer kill you and always awakens your Stand.

```
Archer of the Arrow ──(2% of its shots)──► the Arrow
DIO ──► Vampire Blood ──► Unstable Blood ──► Bearer's Elixir ──► vampire + Stand bearer
bearer ──► the Arrow always awakens a Stand
no Elixir ──► 70% death (marked unworthy) / 30% a Stand awakens
```

## 💀 Archer of the Arrow 

A skeleton in a golden crown and a purple coat that replaces natural skeletons.

| Field | Value (config `entities.arrow-skeleton`) |
|---|---|
| Spawn | `spawn-chance` 0.04 of natural skeletons (× `spawn-rate-multiplier`) |
| Health / speed | `health` 50 · `speed` 0.28 |
| Bow | Power III; crown and coat never drop |
| The Arrow | `stand-arrow-chance` **0.02**: 2 shots in 100 |
| Death | `death-chance` **0.7** |
| Manual spawn | `/msc spawn arrowskeleton` |

The Arrow glows gold, leaves a trail, rings a bell when fired and cannot be picked up. When it
pierces a player:

| Outcome | When | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Stand** | Drank the Bearer's Elixir (bearer) | Never dies: a Stand always awakens, rolled by rarity |
| **Death** | 70%, not a bearer | Dies whatever their armour or totem; its own death messages (3 in `arrow-death-messages`). Marked **unworthy** |
| **Stand** | 30%, not a bearer | Survives and a Stand awakens, rolled by rarity |
| **Rejected** | Unworthy, not a bearer | The Arrow passes through: no Stand until they drink the Bearer's Elixir, which lifts the mark |
| **Resonance** | Already a Stand user | The Arrow fades: it neither kills nor gives another |

## 🩸 DIO and Vampire Blood

DIO drops **1–2 Vampire Blood** when he falls (`entities.dio-brando.vampire-blood-min/max`). It is
the only component of the plugin a brewing stand accepts:

| Step | Base | Ingredient | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Awkward Potion | **Vampire Blood** | Unstable Blood |
| 2 | Unstable Blood | Wither Rose | **Bearer's Elixir** |

Neither potion has a vanilla type, so no vanilla recipe can turn them into something else.

### Drinking the Bearer's Elixir

- You become a **Stand bearer**: if the Arrow chooses you, your Stand awakens.
- You become a **vampire** (stored in the player: it survives restarts and deaths):
  - ☀ **The sun burns you**: in daytime under the open sky you take `vampire.sun-damage` (2)
    **true damage** every second. It goes straight to your health past armour, Resistance,
    enchantments, absorption hearts and totems. A roof protects you; so does rain
    (`rain-protects`).
  - Dying to the sun shows its own death message, one of three (`vampire.sun-death-messages`).
  - 🌙 **The night is yours**: Strength I and Speed I at night, night vision always and 15%
    lifesteal on melee hits (`vampire.lifesteal`).

## 「」 The Stands

| Stand | Rarity | Abilities |
|---|---|---|
| Hermit Purple | 30 | **F**: Spirit Photography — every living thing within 48 blocks glows; the nearest player is named |
| Magician's Red | 25 | **F**: Crossfire Hurricane — a fan of 3 burning ankhs (6 damage, no block fire) |
| Crazy Diamond | 18 | **F**: Restoration — heals 8 to the player you look at (or you) and mends half of what they hold |
| Killer Queen | 14 | **Passive**: First Bomb · **F or `/stand sha`**: Sheer Heart Attack |
| Star Platinum | 10 | **F**: ORA ORA barrage · **Sneak + left click**: stops time 1.5 s |
| The World | 3 | **F**: MUDA MUDA barrage · **Sneak + left click**: ZA WARUDO, 3 s |

- **Sneak + F** (swap hands) summons or sends back the Stand. It floats behind the right shoulder
  with an aura in its colour and steps forward for barrages.
- Rarity, damage, radius and cooldowns live under `stands.<stand>` in config.yml.
- **Stopping time** freezes players, mobs and projectiles in the radius. Bosses and Star Platinum
  or The World users keep moving.

### 💣 Killer Queen

- **First Bomb (passive)**: every player you hit also takes an explosion (`explosion-damage` 4,
  one per `explosion-cooldown-ms` 1500). `include-mobs: true` blows up mobs too;
  `require-summoned: true` needs the Stand out.
- **Sheer Heart Attack** (`/stand sha`, or F with Killer Queen out): a menu with the head of every
  online player opens. Pick one and a small skull-faced tank rolls out:
  - **Immortal**: made of displays, it has no health and no hitbox.
  - **Slow** (`sha-speed` 0.12 blocks per tick); it rolls along the ground, climbing steps.
  - When it cannot go on (a wall, a cliff, a ceiling) it **phases through the blocks** towards its
    target and rolls again as soon as there is ground.
  - It **keeps its chunk loaded**, so it never stops for lack of players.
  - It **explodes** on reaching its target (`sha-damage` 18, no block damage).
  - If the target **leaves the server, it vanishes**. In another world, it waits where it is.
  - One at a time, `sha-cooldown-seconds` 300.

## 🧱 Stand models

Every Stand with a body (Star Platinum, The World, Magician's Red, Crazy Diamond, Killer Queen) and
DIO himself are drawn with **eleven textured player heads** (head, chest, belly, upper arms,
forearms, thighs and shins); DIO's armour stand is only his hitbox now. The models ship in the jar
(`stands/<name>.txt`, BDEngine `/summon` format, made from player skins by `tools/stand-skins`):
the plugin reads each one as it is, stands it up straight and animates it on its own skeleton (breathing, the head following its
user, elbows and knees bending, the barrage, every move of DIO's The World).

A server can replace any of them: put a BDEngine `/summon` export, pasted as it is, in
`plugins/MultiverseCreatures/stands/<name>.txt` (`star-platinum.txt`, `dio-brando.txt`, ...) and
run `/msc reload`. A file that cannot be read is reported in the console and the built-in model is
used instead. The folder's `README.txt` repeats this. Hermit Purple has no body: it stays a coil of
thorned vines round its user's arm.

## ⚔️ Boss weapons

| Weapon | Recipe | Abilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Executioner's Guillotine** (netherite axe) | `E C E / · A · / · W ·` — 2 Executioner's Edges, iron chain, netherite axe, Executioner's Warrant | Sentence (+40% below 30% health), Bleed (Wither I), Chains of Judgment (right click), Guillotine Drop (sneak + right click) |
| **Architect's Deployer** (bow) | `· E · / N K N / · B ·` — echo shard, 2 netherite ingots, Architect Kernel, bow | Guided packets (+20%), sudo rm -rf (sneak + left click, 40 block beam), Failover (below 30% health you jump behind the attacker) |

NIX always drops **1 Executioner's Edge** and a second one 35% of the time (`edge-drop-chance`,
`edge-bonus-chance`). JACKSTAR still drops his **Architect Kernel**, which besides summoning him is
now the core of the Deployer.
